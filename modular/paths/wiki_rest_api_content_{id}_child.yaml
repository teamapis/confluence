  summary: Get content children
  description: >-
    Returns a map of the direct children of a piece of content. A piece of
    content

    has different types of child content, depending on its type. These are

    the default parent-child content type relationships:


    - `page`: child content is `page`, `comment`, `attachment`

    - `blogpost`: child content is `comment`, `attachment`

    - `attachment`: child content is `comment`

    - `comment`: child content is `attachment`


    Apps can override these default relationships. Apps can also introduce

    new content types that create new parent-child content relationships.


    Note, the map will always include all child content types that are valid

    for the content. However, if the content has no instances of a child content

    type, the map will contain an empty array for that child content type.


    **[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/_AozKw) required**:
    'View' permission for the space,

    and permission to view the content if it is a page.
