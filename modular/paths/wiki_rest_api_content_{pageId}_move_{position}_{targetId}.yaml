  summary: Move a page to a new location relative to a target page
  description: >-
    Move a page to a new location relative to a target page:


    * `before` - move the page under the same parent as the target, before the
    target in the list of children

    * `after` - move the page under the same parent as the target, after the
    target in the list of children

    * `append` - move the page to be a child of the target


    Caution: This API can move pages to the top level of a space. Top-level
    pages are difficult to find in the UI

    because they do not show up in the page tree display. To avoid this, never
    use `before` or `after` positions

    when the `targetId` is a top-level page.

        - A page already exists in the target space with the same name.
          User is advised to rename page before moving.
        - The move would create a parent-child loop (page becomes a descendant
        and ancestor of itself)

        - The page has permission restrictions that the user does not have
        permission to create in the target space.
          User is advised to remove restrictions before moving.
