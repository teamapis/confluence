  summary: Remove label from content
  description: >-
    Removes a label from a piece of content. This is similar to

    [Remove label from content using query
    parameter](#api-content-id-label-delete)

    except that the label name is specified via a path parameter.


    Use this method if the label name does not have "/" characters, as the path

    parameter does not accept "/" characters for security reasons. Otherwise,

    use [Remove label from content using query
    parameter](#api-content-id-label-delete).


    **[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/_AozKw) required**:

    Permission to update the content.
