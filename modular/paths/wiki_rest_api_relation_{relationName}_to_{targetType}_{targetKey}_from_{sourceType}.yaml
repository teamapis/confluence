  summary: Find source entities related to a target entity
  description: |-
    Returns all target entities that have a particular relationship to the
    source entity. Note, relationships are one way.

    For example, the following method finds all users that have a 'collaborator'
    relationship to a piece of content with an ID of '1234':
    `GET /wiki/rest/api/relation/collaborator/to/content/1234/from/user`
    Note, 'collaborator' is an example custom relationship type.

    **[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/_AozKw) required**:
    Permission to view both the target entity and source entity.

        Note, this method does not support 'like' or 'favourite' relationships.
