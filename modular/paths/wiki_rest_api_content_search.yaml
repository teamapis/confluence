  summary: Search content by CQL
  description: >-
    Returns the list of content that matches a Confluence Query Language

    (CQL) query. For information on CQL, see:

    [Advanced searching using
    CQL](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/advanced-searching-using-cql/).


    Example initial call:

    ```

    /wiki/rest/api/content/search?cql=type=page&limit=25

    ```


    Example response:

    ```

    {
      "results": [
        { ... },
        { ... },
        ...
        { ... }
      ],
      "limit": 25,
      "size": 25,
      ...
      "_links": {
        "base": "<url>",
        "context": "<url>",
        "next": "/rest/api/content/search?cql=type=page&limit=25&cursor=raNDoMsTRiNg",
        "self": "<url>"
      }
    }

    ```


    When additional results are available, returns `next` and `prev` URLs to
    retrieve them in subsequent calls. The URLs each contain a cursor that
    points to the appropriate set of results. Use `limit` to specify the number
    of results returned in each call.

    Example subsequent call (taken from example response):

    ```

    /wiki/rest/api/content/search?cql=type=page&limit=25&cursor=raNDoMsTRiNg

    ```

    The response to this will have a `prev` URL similar to the `next` in the
    example response.
