  summary: Get content restriction status for group
  description: >-
    Returns whether the specified content restriction applies to a group.

    For example, if a page with `id=123` has a `read` restriction for the
    `admins` group,

    the following request will return `true`:


    `/wiki/rest/api/content/123/restriction/byOperation/read/group/admins`


    Note that a response of `true` does not guarantee that the group can view
    the page, as it does not account for

    account-inherited restrictions, space permissions, or even product access.

    information, see [Confluence
