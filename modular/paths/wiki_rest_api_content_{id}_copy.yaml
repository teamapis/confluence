  summary: Copy single page
  description: >-
    Copies a single page and its associated properties, permissions,
    attachments, and custom contents.
     The `id` path parameter refers to the content ID of the page to copy. The target of the page to be copied
     is defined using the `destination` in the request body and can be one of the following types.

      - `space`: page will be copied to the specified space as a root page on the space
      - `parent_page`: page will be copied as a child of the specified parent page
      - `existing_page`: page will be copied and replace the specified page

    By default, the following objects are expanded: `space`, `history`,
    `version`.


    **[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/_AozKw) required**: 'Add'
    permission for the space that the content will be copied in and permission
    to update the content if copying to an `existing_page`.
