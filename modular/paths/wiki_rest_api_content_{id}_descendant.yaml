    - Content - children and descendants
  summary: Get content descendants
  description: >-
    Returns a map of the descendants of a piece of content. This is similar

    to [Get content children](#api-content-id-child-get), except that this

    method returns child pages at all levels, rather than just the direct

    child pages.


    A piece of content has different types of descendants, depending on its
    type:


    - `page`: descendant is `page`, `comment`, `attachment`

    - `blogpost`: descendant is `comment`, `attachment`

    - `attachment`: descendant is `comment`

    - `comment`: descendant is `attachment`


    The map will always include all descendant types that are valid for the
    content.

    However, if the content has no instances of a descendant type, the map will

    contain an empty array for that descendant type.


    **[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/_AozKw) required**:

    'View' permission for the space, and permission to view the content if it

    is a page.
