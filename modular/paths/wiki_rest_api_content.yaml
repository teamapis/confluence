    Creates a new piece of content or publishes an existing draft.


    To publish a draft, add the `id` and `status` properties to the body of the
    request.

    Set the `id` to the ID of the draft and set the `status` to 'current'. When
    the

    request is sent, a new piece of content will be created and the metadata
    from the

    draft will be transferred into it.


    By default, the following objects are expanded: `space`, `history`,
    `version`.


    **[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/_AozKw) required**: 'Add'
    permission for the

    space that the content will be created in, and permission to view the draft
    if publishing a draft.

      [Confluence storage format](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/AJkiLw).


      If you are not sure how to generate the different formats, you can create
      a page in the

      Confluence application, retrieve the content using [Get
      content](#api-content-get),

      and expand the desired content format, e.g. `expand=body.storage`.
