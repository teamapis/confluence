    - Content - macro body
  summary: Get macro body by macro ID
  description: >-
    Returns the body of a macro in storage format, for the given macro ID.

    This includes information like the name of the macro, the body of the macro,

    and any macro parameters. This method is mainly used by Cloud apps.


    About the macro ID: When a macro is created in a new version of content,

    Confluence will generate a random ID for it, unless an ID is specified

    (by an app). The macro ID will look similar to this:
    '50884bd9-0cb8-41d5-98be-f80943c14f96'.

    The ID is then persisted as new versions of content are created, and is

    only modified by Confluence if there are conflicting IDs.


    Note, to preserve backwards compatibility this resource will also match on

    the hash of the macro body, even if a macro ID is found. This check will

    eventually become redundant, as macro IDs are generated for pages and

    transparently propagate out to all instances.


    **[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/_AozKw) required**:

    Permission to view the content that the macro is in.

        The version of the content that contains the macro. Specifying `0` as
        the `version` will return

        the macro body for the latest content version.

        The ID of the macro. This is usually passed by the app that the
        macro is in. Otherwise, find the macro ID by querying the desired
        content and version, then expanding the body in storage format.
        For example, '/content/196611/version/7?expand=content.body.storage'.
