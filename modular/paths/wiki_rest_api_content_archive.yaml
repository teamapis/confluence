  summary: Archive pages
  description: >-
    Archives a list of pages. The pages to be archived are specified as a list
    of content IDs.

    This API accepts the archival request and returns a task ID.

    The archival process happens asynchronously.

    Use the /longtask/<taskId> REST API to get the copy task status.


    Each content ID needs to resolve to page objects that are not already in an
    archived state.

    The content IDs need not belong to the same space.


    **[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/_AozKw) required**:

    'Archive' permission for each of the pages in the corresponding space it
    belongs to.
