  summary: Create or update attachment
  description: >-
    Adds an attachment to a piece of content. If the attachment already exists

    for the content, then the attachment is updated (i.e. a new version of the

    attachment is created).


    Note, you must set a `X-Atlassian-Token: nocheck` header on the request

    for this method, otherwise it will be blocked. This protects against XSRF

    attacks, which is necessary as this method accepts multipart/form-data.


    The media type 'multipart/form-data' is defined in [RFC
    7578](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7578.txt).

    Most client libraries have classes that make it easier to implement

    multipart posts, like the
    [MultipartEntityBuilder](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-5.1.x/current/httpclient5/apidocs/)

    Java class provided by Apache HTTP Components.


    Note, according to [RFC
    7578](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7578#section-4.5),

    in the case where the form data is text,

    the charset parameter for the "text/plain" Content-Type may be used to

    indicate the character encoding used in that part. In the case of this

    API endpoint, the `comment` body parameter should be sent with
    `type=text/plain`

    and `charset=utf-8` values. This will force the charset to be UTF-8.


    Example: This curl command attaches a file ('example.txt') to a piece of

    content (id='123') with a comment and `minorEdits`=true. If the
    'example.txt'

    file already exists, it will update it with a new version of the attachment.


    ``` bash

    curl -D- \
      -u admin:admin \
      -X PUT \
      -H 'X-Atlassian-Token: nocheck' \
      -F 'file=@"example.txt"' \
      -F 'minorEdit="true"' \
      -F 'comment="Example attachment comment"; type=text/plain; charset=utf-8' \
      http://myhost/rest/api/content/123/child/attachment
