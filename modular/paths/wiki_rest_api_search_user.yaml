        The CQL query to be used for the search. See

        [Advanced Searching using
        CQL](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/advanced-searching-using-cql/)

        for instructions on how to build a CQL query.


        Example queries:
                  cql=type=user will return all users
                  cql=user="1234" will return user with accountId "1234"
                  You can also use IN, NOT IN, != operators
                  cql=user IN ("12", "34") will return users with accountids "12" and "34"
                  cql=user.fullname~jo will return users with nickname/full name starting with "jo"
                  cql=user.accountid="123" will return user with accountId "123"
