  description: >-
    Creates a property for an existing piece of content. For more information

    about content properties, see [Confluence entity
    properties](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/confluence-entity-properties/).


    This is the same as [Create content property for
    key](#api-content-id-property-key-post)

    except that the key is specified in the request body instead of as a

    path parameter.


    Content properties can also be added when creating a new piece of content

    by including them in the `metadata.properties` of the request.


    **[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/_AozKw) required**:

    Permission to update the content.
