  summary: Get content children by type
  description: >-
    Returns all children of a given type, for a piece of content.

    A piece of content has different types of child content, depending on its
    type:


    - `page`: child content is `page`, `comment`, `attachment`

    - `blogpost`: child content is `comment`, `attachment`

    - `attachment`: child content is `comment`

    - `comment`: child content is `attachment`


    Custom content types that are provided by apps can also be returned.


    Note, this method only returns direct children. To return children at all

    levels, use [Get descendants by type](#api-content-id-descendant-type-get).


    **[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/_AozKw) required**:
    'View' permission for the space,

    and permission to view the content if it is a page.
