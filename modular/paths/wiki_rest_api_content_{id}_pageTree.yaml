  summary: Delete page tree
  description: >-
    Moves a pagetree rooted at a page to the space's trash:


    - If the content's type is `page` and its status is `current`, it will be
    trashed including

    all its descendants.

    - For every other combination of content type and status, this API is not
    supported.


    This API accepts the pageTree delete request and returns a task ID.

    The delete process happens asynchronously.

     Response example:
     <pre><code>
     {
          "id" : "1180606",
          "links" : {
               "status" : "/rest/api/longtask/1180606"
          }
     }
     </code></pre>
     Use the `/longtask/<taskId>` REST API to get the copy task status.

    **[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/_AozKw) required**:

    'Delete' permission for the space that the content is in.
