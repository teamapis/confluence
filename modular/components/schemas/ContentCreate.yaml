      The body of the new content. Does not apply to attachments.

      Only one body format should be specified as the property for

      this object, e.g. `storage`.


      Note, `editor2` format is used by Atlassian only. `anonymous_export_view`
      is

      the same as `export_view` format but only content viewable by an anonymous

      user is included.
