  The body of the new content. Does not apply to attachments.
  Only one body format should be specified as the property for
  this object, e.g. `storage`.

  Note, `editor2` format is used by Atlassian only. `anonymous_export_view` is
  the same as `export_view` format but only content viewable by an anonymous
  user is included.
